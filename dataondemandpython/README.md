# On Demand Data in Python

A tutorial in four parts, by [Uche Ogbuji](http://uche.ogbuji.net)

[Part 1: Python Iterators and Generators](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ba-on-demand-data-python-1/)

For the longest time the standard way to process data in [Python](https://www.python.org/) was by building up data in lists, dictionaries and other such data structures. Many Python developers learn such techniques, and though in many cases they work well, they cause major problems when dealing with large quantities os data. It's easy to find the code running painfully slowly, or even running out of memory with such static data structures. Generators and iterators are techniques that have been around in Python for a while, and can help alleviate such problems.

[Part 2: The magic of itertools](https://www.ibm.com/developerworks/library/ba-on-demand-data-python-1/)

Python's motto has always been "Batteries included", to highlight its extensive standard library. Regardless there are many well-kept secrets among the standard modules, including itertools, which is less well known in part because iterators and generators are less well known. They are an essential part of the toolkit for workig woth these.
